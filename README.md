## MVP (Model-View-Presenter)
  is a derivation of the model–view–controller (MVC) architectural pattern which mostly used for building user interfaces. 
  In MVP, the presenter assumes the functionality of the “middle-man”. In MVP, all presentation logic is pushed to the presenter.
  MVP advocates separating business and persistence 
  logic out of the Activity and Fragment
  
## Benefits

+ View more separated from Model. The Presenter is the mediator between Model and View.
+ Easier to create unit tests
+ Generally there is a one to one mapping between View and Presenter, with the possibility to use multiple Presenters for complex Views
+ Listen to user action and model updates
+ Updates model and view as well
